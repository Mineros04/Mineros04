# Hi,
### I'm @Mineros04!

I'm a __high school__ student living in Czech Republic. I'm always open to suggestions regarding my public repositories.
You can contact me about anything anytime and I might answer you based on your question.

## What languages do I use to code?
I mostly do __JavaScript__ at the moment, however I don't mind visiting _PHP, C# or Python_ sometimes. I also wish to learn
those languages more, as well as some new ones, like _Java or Rust_.
