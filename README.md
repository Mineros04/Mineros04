# Hi,
### I'm @Mineros04!

I'm a __high school__ student living in Czech Republic. I'm always open to suggestions regarding my public repositories.
You can contact me about anything anytime and I might answer you based on your question.

## What languages do I use to code?
I mostly do __JavaScript__ at the moment, however I don't mind visiting _PHP, C# or Python_ sometimes. I also wish to learn
those languages more, as well as some new ones, like _Java or Rust_.

## > I would like to contact you somehow. Where can I?
_You __would__? Can't believe, who would want to contact me?_
Ehm... Anyways. You can contact me on my Discord: __Mineros04#4444__, where I am open to your questions and stuff.
For anyone curious about my other stuff, here is my [linktr.ee](https://linktr.ee/mineros04 "My linktr.ee").
